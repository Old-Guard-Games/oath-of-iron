When we left off [last time]({% post_url 2020-11-23-ida-and-the-deer %}),
Ida and Whisper were approaching a large man by his campmfire as evening was settling in.
We know from the fiction that he's a large fellow, but the question is whether he is a human, or something else.
Let's consult the oracle.
I put the chances at about 50/50.

{% include oracle.html
  title="50/50"
  d100="13"
  result="No"
  %}

Interesting. So he isn't a human. Another option would be a half-giant, which is "likely."

{% include oracle.html
  title="Likely"
  d100="45"
  result="Yes"
  %}

So we have a half-giant man.

One other question before we learn more about him.
Does Ida know this guy? Unlikely, but possible.
It could be interesting either way.

{% include oracle.html
  title="Unlikely"
  d100="72"
  result="No"
  %}

Ooh, Ida does not know this guy, but it was close (unlikely is 76 or higher).
Maybe Ida knows the guy by reputation but has never met him.
Let's consult some other oracles to see what sort of fellow he is and what he wants.

{% include oracle.html
  title="Character Disposition"
  d100="39"
  result="Suspicious"
  %}

{% include oracle.html
  title="Character Descriptor"
  d100="72"
  result="Confident"
  %}

{% include oracle.html
  title="Character Goal"
  d100="65"
  result="Protect a person"
  %}

{% include oracle.html
  title="Character Role"
  d100="77"
  result="Warrior"
  %}

And finally, after consulting my [favorite fantasy name generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/giant-names.php),
we have Ragal, the confident but suspicious warrior, who wishes to protect someone.
Given the results, it seems most straightforward to have Ragal be a Warden from a different village.

## Ragal Redclaw

{% prose %}
  The silhouette of a tall man wearing thick furs looms ahead, outlined by the campfire's glow.
  Ida calls out, "Hail, stranger!"

  The huge furred figure springs to action, and before Ida has much of a chance to even fully process what is happening,
  the strange man is crouched facing her, massive axe held at the ready.
  "Who are you?!" he snarls at her. "What do you want?"

  Whisper does not take kindly to sudden aggression and the wolf bares his fangs and lets out a menacing growl. 
  "Whoah," Ida says, stepping in front of Whisper, still facing the stranger.
  "We aren't here to fight. We just saw your fire and thought we would join you, maybe trade."
{% endprose %}

This is a tense situation, and it seems like Ida is trying to "charm, pacify, or convince" this stranger, which then triggers the Compel move, +Heart in this case.

{% include roll.html
  title="Compel"
  d6="5"
  stat_name="Heart"
  stat="2"
  adds="0"
  chal1="1"
  chal2="6"
%}

> On a **strong hit,** theyâ€™ll do what you want or share what they know.
Take +1 momentum.
If you use this exchange to _Gather Information,_ make that move now and add +1.

That brings us up to +6 momentum, and I do believe that we will be gathering information as we sit with this fellow.
We'll go ahead and roll now so the narrative context is ready for the fiction.

{% include roll.html
  title="Gather Information"
  d6="4"
  stat_name="Wits"
  stat="3"
  adds="1"
  adds_title="+1 from Compel"
  chal1="9"
  chal2="6"
%}

> On a **weak hit,** the information complicates your quest or introduces a new danger.
Envision what you discover (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and take +1 momentum.

And the theme of this discovery is?

{% prose %}
  The man's posture relaxes slightly, but his suspicion holds.
  "Come into the light so I can see you better."
  Ida walks forward, muttering under her breath at Whisper to be good.
  Hackles still up, the wolf follows her into the light.
  He looks from Ida to the Whisper for a moment before a look of recognition lights his face.
  "Red hair, wolf, short.
  You must be that Warden from Ravenhall."

  Ida relaxes as well, and nods.
  "Aye, I am Ida," she says, extending her hand and considering the man.
  She notes the bear's head inscribed into the double-headed axe he carries.
  "And you must be Ragal Redclaw.
  That's a distinctive weapon."

  "I am, and it is.
  Come sit. My fire is your fire."
  The half-giant gestures to a stone near the fire and Ida takes a seat on it.
  Whisper warily sits beside her, not taking his eyes off the man.
  Ragal claims his own rock nearer to the fire and begins poking the contents of a copper pan with a charred stick.
  The fat in the pan pops and hisses, sizzling against the meat within.
  "Your wolf is not trusting me,"
  In the wild places, your wolf is smart to not trust a stranger."
  He rests his stick on the pan, then reaches into a leather satchel beside him.
  After a moment, he withdraws a small parcel wrapped in a thin leather cover.
  Pulling it back, he holds the contents out to Whisper.
  "Salted liver. I don't like it much, but maybe the wolf does?"

  Whisper sniffs the offering and snatches it up, devouring the liver in only a few chomps.
  Ida smiles as he eats.
  "Although we haven't met, I wouldn't call us strangers exactly.
  You are the Warden of Whitecairn. I have heard many stories of you."
  Indeed Ragal Redclaw was quite well known among Wardens.
  It was said that he once faced down a ragemane alone with nothing but his axe and a light tunic.
  Judging by the curved horn hanging off his pack, that rumor might just be true.

  "Most stories are taller than I am," Ragal says, smiling.
  "But only a little."

  Ida begins fishing through her own pack, and extends a red sack to Ragal.
  "I offer owlberries in trade for some of the meat in that pan.
  I was hunting a deer, but the blight had already taken it."

  Ragal nods, accepting the bag.
  He pulls out a handful of berries and tosses them into the pan, where they sputter in the fat.
  "Blight has been bad lately."
  He points to the stream.
  "Red bubbles going down the stream are not good.
  Got the people in Whitecairn scared.
  The new shaman said the blight needs cleaning by fire.
  The hunters been killing all the deer and boar they find with blight and burning them in
  town.
  When the fire goes out, the shaman washes the ashes down the stream."
  He points to the bank nearby.
  "Not good."

  Ida shakes her head.
  "That is unacceptable.
  They are washing their problems downstream to my people.
  Is it at least reducing the blight near Whitecairn?"

  Ragal takes a moment to consider his answer as he stirs.
  "Maybe a little," he says as he wraps a strip of cloth around the handle of the pan.
  "If it is getting lighter, it is not much."
  He pulls a wooden disk from his pack and empties a portion of the food from the pan onto it.
  Ida can see that the meat she's been smelling is boar, accompanied by wild roots and owlberries.
  Ragal holds the pan out to her.

  "Thank you," she says. She pulls the knife out of its sheath on her belt and begins eating.
  After living for several days on mostly tree nuts and sour berries,
  her stomach very enthusiastically accepts her offering of savory pork.
  "This is amazing," she says, wiping grease off her chin.
  "There haven't been many boar near Ravenhall in the last few weeks."
  She motions toward the stream. "Maybe I know why."

  Ragal nods, then speaks through a mouthful of food.
  "Boar have better senses for this thing than others.
  This is salted. I killed it weeks ago."
  He lets out a loud belch, then quickly glances at Ida slightly embarrassed.
  "Sorry. Forgot my manners."

  Ida chuckles and returns the belch.
  "I am a Warden, not a blushing maid."
  She uses her knife to shovel the sauce and leftover vegetables to the side of her plate and into her mouth,
  then hands the last two bites of boar to Whisper, who consumes them greedily and looks expectantly for more.
  "That's it for now, friend. We will hunt together soon and you can have a feast."
  The wolf chuffs his displeasure at her as she locks gazes with Ragal.
  "I will need to travel to Whitecairn and stop this," she says, waving her empty plate at the water nearby.
  "If I don't stop this before it gets worse, my village will be unprepared for the winter."

  The half-giant reaches out and takes the plate from Ida and lays it on the ground beside his own.
  "Will you fight them?" he asks, staring intently into her eyes.

  "Them?" she asks. "I have no complaint with the people of your village.
  If this shaman will not stop fouling the water, I may have issue with him."
  Her returned gaze is unwavering as she pulls out her pendant.
  "I will not be a danger to the folk of Whitecairn unless they are a danger to Ravenhall."

  Ragal's eyes flit from Ida's to the pendant in her hand.
  "An oath on the black iron," he says, approving.
  "Good."

  Whisper's ears perk up and his attention snaps to a spot in the darkness outside the firelight.
  "What is it, Whisper?" Ida asks, peering out to see if she can catch what the wolf is sensing.
  She slowly grabs her staff and stands, and she can see Ragal standing as well.
  The creak of her leathers sounds louder in the evening quiet, and suddenly Ida realizes that the forest has gone very quiet indeed.
  A snapping twig from the darkness sounds like a hammerblow in the near silence.

  Lambent yellow eyes shine from the darkness accompanied by a chuckling growl.
  A creature about half again as tall as Ida and nearly as wide walks up to the edge of the campfire's light.
  The beast's spade-like muzzle drips with frothy spittle as it splits open wider, looking like a wide, evil grin.
  Its chuckling growl rises in pitch as the Cackler digs its claws into the earth and prepares to pounce.
{% endprose %}


There is definitely about to be a throwdown between Ida, Whisper, Ragal and this Cackler.
However, that throwdown will wait until next time.
Until then, stay safe out there!
