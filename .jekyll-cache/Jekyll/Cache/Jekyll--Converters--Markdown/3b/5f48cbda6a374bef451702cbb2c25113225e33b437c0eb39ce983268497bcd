I"Z<p>In <a href="/worldbuilding-part-i-the-land">Part I</a>, we discussed what the land is like, and a bit of history.
Then we learned some important things about our people in <a href="worldbuilding-part-ii-the-people">Part II</a>.
Definitely check those out if you missed them, because they will inform many decisions we make moving forward.</p>
