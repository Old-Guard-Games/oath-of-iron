I"à<p>I think that it will be easier to get a good picture of who our protagonist will be if we first understand where she is coming from, in the literal sense.
Ironsworn has a built-in setting with a nice set of options for several decision points on the specifics.
I really like the way itâ€™s set up, but I think Iâ€™d prefer to play in my groupâ€™s homebrew setting, Kalemin, instead.
Since I and my group created it, I know that setting fairly well. I also know that there are still many blank spots in the lore and the map to explore.
As I was reading through the world creation options, though, I discovered a pleasant surprise: If I set up the game at the right place in the right time, I donâ€™t even have to do much editing.</p>
