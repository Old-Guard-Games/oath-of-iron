# What's This About?

Welcome to Oath of Iron, an Ironsworn blog.  Ironsworn is a Powered by the Apocalypse game created by Shawn Tomkin. It was designed from the ground up to be played in several different ways: Guided (with a GM), cooperatively (multiple players without a GM), or solo (single player, no GM). This blog will contain accounts of solo gameplay by yours truly.

The solo aspect of Ironsworn is what really drew me to it. I've tried solo tabletop games in the past, but nothing *sang* to me. Some games felt like a slightly crunchier choose-your-own-adventure book, while others were a bit too far on the rules light side of things and ended up feeling more like writing a novel than playing an RPG.  From what I can tell having done some exploratory testing, Ironsworn hits a sweet spot.

There are several aspects of the game that help it achieve its solo goals.
We discuss that in more detail in the [Introduction]({{'/posts/introduction.html' | relative_url }}). Check it out!
